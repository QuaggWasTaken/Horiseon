# Horiseon
This GitHub repo was created from refactoring the HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor source code, obtained from Vanderbilt's HTML CSS JS Full Stack Web Development Course.

The project itself was to refactor the webpage to be suitable for SEO, including adding alt properties for images, and changing page architecture and CSS architecture to match industry standards
